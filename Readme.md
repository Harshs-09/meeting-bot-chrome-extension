# üß† Meeting-Bot Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that records meeting audio (tab + mic), saves the recording locally and sends it to your FastAPI backend for transcription and diarization. 

&nbsp;
## üöÄ Features

1. Captures both tab and microphone audio.

2. Sends recordings to your backend for processing.
3. Supports FastAPI servers running locally (via Docker).
4. Easy-to-use popup interface.


&nbsp;
## üõ† Installation (Developer Mode)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshs-09/meeting-bot-chrome-extension.git
   cd meeting-bot-chrome-extension
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to **"chrome://extensions/"** .
3. Enable Developer mode (top-right toggle).
4. Click **‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù** and select the cloned folder.
5. The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.


&nbsp;
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The extension sends audio to your FastAPI backend at: 
```bash
http://localhost:9000/file/upload?source=extension
```

You can change this in the popup.js if needed:
```js
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:9000/file/upload?source=extension") 
```
If you are sending request to a different backend server make sure to:
1. Update the frontend code for your response format.

2. Ensure your backend includes the following CORS middleware:
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "chrome-extension://*",  # Allow all Chrome extensions
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
